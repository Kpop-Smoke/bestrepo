Hello, my name is Christian and I am a freshman studying Data Science at BU. 
I am fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and my favorite class at BU so far has been DS 110 which is an introduction to Python, but I also enjoyed my business elective being "Ideas the Impact." 
I also want to minor in business starting next semester.
